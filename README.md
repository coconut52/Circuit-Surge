## Testing

#### API Testing
**Mocha** was used for API testing due to its simplicity for end-to-end tests. We checked for expected behavior in various operations such as user registration, login, and fetching user profiles.

#### Authentication and Authorization Testing
- **Authentication**: Ensures that users can log in with valid credentials and receive an authentication token.
- **Authorization**: Verifies that only authenticated users can access protected routes using the provided token.
